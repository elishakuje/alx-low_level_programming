C - Function Pointers 
 ----------------------------
This project was done during **Software Engineering Studies** at **alx_africa/holberton_school**. It aims is to learn about:
- function pointers and how to use them.
- What does a function pointer exactly hold. 
- Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory in **C language**

Technologies
  --------------------------
                              
C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS   

Files
 ---------------------------

The following files are programs written in C:
| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0-print_name.c` | Prints a name |
| `1-array_iterator.c` | Executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array. |
| `2-int_index.c` | Searches for an integer. |
| `3-calc.h` | Header file that contains all function prototypes and data structures |
| `3-op_functions.c` | File that contains functions that calculates arithmetic operations |
| `3-get_op_func.c` | Function pointer that returns the pointer of the arithmetic functions |
| `3-main.c` | Entry point |
| `100-main_opcodes.c` | Prints the opcodes of its own main function |
