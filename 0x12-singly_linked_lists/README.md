 ---------------------------

This project was done during **Software Engineering Studies** at **alx_africa/holberton_school**. It aims is to learn about:
- linked lists as a **Data Structure in C Language**
- When and why using linked lists vs arrays
- How to build and use linked lists.

Technologies
 ----------------------------

- C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

The following files are programs written in C:
| Filename | Description |
