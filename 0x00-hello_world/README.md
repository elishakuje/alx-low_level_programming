C Hello, World
 			
 -------------------------------
This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies @ alx africa. it aims was to learn about what is entry point, basics c commands (puts, printf, putchar),the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof, the right header to include when using a standard library function, and compilation process with gcc in **C language.**

Technologies
 ---------------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
- C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Files
 ---------------------------------
The following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| File name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0-preprocessor` |Runs a C file through the preprocessor and saves the result into another file  |
| `1-compiler` |  Compiles a C file but does not link |
| `2-assembler` | Generates the assembly code of a C code and saves it in an output file |
| `3-name` | Compiles a C file and creates an executable named `cisfun` |
| `4-puts.c` | Prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle` |
| `5-printf.c` | Prints exactly `with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,` followed by a new line |
| `6-size.c` |  Prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on |
| `100-intel` | Generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file |
| `101-quote.c` | Prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line, to the standard error |
