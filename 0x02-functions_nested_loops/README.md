Functions, nested loops
 ------------------------------

Project done during Software Engineering studies at Alx africa. It aims to learn about header files, functions, loops and nested loops in **C language.**

Technologies
  ----------------------------

Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
C files are compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
