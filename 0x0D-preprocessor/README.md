C - Preprocessor
 -----------------------------

This project was done during **Software Engineering Studies** at ** alx_africa/holberton_school**. It aims is to learn about:-
- Macros and how to use them
- Standard predefined Macros and most common predefined Macros
- How to include guard in header files in  **C language**

Technologies
  --------------------------

C files are compiled using gcc 9.4.0
Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Files
  --------------------------

All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0-object_like_macro.h` | Header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`. | 
| `1-pi.h` | Header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`. |
| `2-main.c` | Program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from. |
| `3-function_like_macro.h` | Function-like macro `ABS(x)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`. |
| `4-sum.h` | Function-like macro `SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`. |
