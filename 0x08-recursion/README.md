Recursion
 ----------------------------

These tasks were done during Full Stack Software Engineering Studies at Alx_Africa/Holberton School. It aims was to learn about recursion and how to implement recursion. In what situations to implement recursion and in what situations not to implement recursion.

Technologies
  ------------------------------

- C files are compiled using gcc `9.4.0`
- C files are written according to the C90 standard
- Tested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`

Files
 -------------------------------

The following files are scripts and programme written in C:

| Filename | Description
|--- | ---|
| `0-puts_recursion.c` | A function that prints a string |
| `1-print_rev_recursion.c` | A function that prints a string in reverse |
| `2-strlen_recursion.c` | A function that returns the length of a string |
| `3-factorial.c` | A function that returns the factorial of a given number |
| `4-pow_recursion.c` | A function that returns the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` |
| `5-sqrt_recursion.c` | A function that returns the natural square root of a number |
| `6-is_prime_number.c` | A function that returns `1` if the input integer is a `prime number,` otherwise return `0` |
| `100-is_palindrome.c` | A function that returns `1` if the string is a palindrome and `0` if not. |
| `101-wildcmp.c` | A function that compares two strings and returns `1` if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return `0` |
